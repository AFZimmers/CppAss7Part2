Question 1:
The minimum number of perceptrons required is 3.
The two input values are fed into the perceptrons NAND and OR which make up the first layer, then there outputs are fed into the AND perceptron
which will give us the answer we wanting.

Question 2:
Each proceptron was trained with 4 training examples so is 12 in total.

Question 3:
They are:
0.763145
0.802184

Question 4:
0.752632

Question 5:
Using (target-output)^2:
0.15416
If I added the scalar of 0.5 so 0.5(target-output)^2 which isnt needed for this example then the answer is:
0.07708
